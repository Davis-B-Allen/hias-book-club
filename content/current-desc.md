## October's Meeting

**Date:** October 28th, 2019, 5:30 to 7:30 pm

**Location:** WeWork, 205 West 37th Street, Manhattan

This month's book is ***Tell Me How It Ends*** by Valeria Luiselli.

Structured around the forty questions Luiselli translates and asks undocumented Latin-American children facing deportation, Tell Me How It Ends (an expansion of her 2016 Freeman's essay of the same name) humanizes these young migrants and highlights the contradiction of the idea of America as a fiction for immigrants with the reality of racism and fear both here and back home.

Also, for those of you who attended September's meeting on Tuesday (and anyone else who is interested), I wanted to include a few links and notes. We discussed "Nailed It," a documentary about Vietnamese nail salons. You can read more about it and watch it (with a rental or purchase cost) here. (If anyone purchases it and wants to share, let us know! Maybe we could even set up a viewing if someone wants to share their space for it). Also, I wanted to include the quote that Urvashi found in the text on page 175: "I never wanted to build a 'body of work,' but to preserve these, our bodies, breathing and unaccounted for, inside the work." This quote, for me, is very salient in representing something important and essential to the novel.
